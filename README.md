Description
===========

PySort is an application that is meant to make the lives of people a bit
easier by taking away the need for them to manually keep their files in order.
It is aimed at any person, from the average user that saves all his/her files to
the desktop (like myself) to professionals that just need a messy folder sorted quickly.

It is coded in Python 3 and not guaranteed to work in Python 2.

Using the App
=============

To run the app, simply run the script with your Python 3 binary.

PySort is quite simple to use.
The GUI (graphic user interface) gives you 3 options:

  1] "Change" Directory - This option allows you to select the directory you want to sort.
     ***DO NOT SELECT IMPORTANT FOLDERS LIKE SYSTEM FOLDERS OR ANY INSTALLED APPLICATION'S FOLDERS***

  2] "SORT" - This option you use once you have selected the folder to sort using "Change Directory".
     
  3] "Exit" - This is used to quit the application.
